        <p>
          <strong>CIRC</strong>, the Canadian International Rover Challenge, is a competition
          where university teams design, build, and operate rovers to compete in
          various tasks that simulate real-world planetary exploration. Teams
          face challenges such as terrain traversal, autonomous navigation, and
          scientific research, pushing the boundaries of innovation and
          engineering.
        </p>
        <p><strong>PURPOSE</strong></p>
        <p>
          University of Windsor Mars Rover Team is excited to join the 2024
          Canadian International Rover Challenge. Our main goal is to provide
          students with hands-on learning in engineering and robotics, preparing
          them for future careers in space exploration. We aim to encourage
          collaboration, innovative problem-solving, and showcase our talents on
          the international stage. Through this experience, we hope to inspire a
          love for science and technology within our university community and
          beyond.
