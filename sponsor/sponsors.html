          Securing in-kind partnership is crucial for the University of
          Windsor's Mars Rover Team as we gear up for the 2024 summer Canadian
          International Rover Challenge. Our Mars Rover, crafted from a diverse
          array of materials, including aluminum, carbon fiber, plastic, and
          steel, requires expertise in multiple manufacturing methods. In this
          pursuit, we are actively seeking assistance from in-kind sponsors who
          can contribute materials and manufacturing services to aid in the
          development of our Mars Rover. Your support in providing these
          essential resources will play a key role in ensuring our team's
          success in the challenges. Join us on this exciting journey as we
          explore new frontiers in space exploration and become an integral part
          of our Mars Rover project through your valuable in-kind partnership
